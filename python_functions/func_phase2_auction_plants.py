Phase 2 - Auction Power Plants

In this phase, each player may have an opportunity to offer a power plant for sale at auction. During the phase, each
player can buy at most one power plant. A player should try to have plants with enough capacity to power all the
cities in his network, but this is not required. The first player starts and chooses between:
a. Pass
b. Choose a poser plant for auction
