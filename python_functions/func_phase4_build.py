Phase 4 - Building

This phase is played in reverse player order. The last player starts. In this phase, the players start or add cities to
their networks on the map. Remember, to win the game a player must be able to power more cities than any other player.
Thus, building a network of cities is essential to winning the game. However, the winner is not necessarily the player
with the most cities - it is the player with the most powered cities. Players must balance their power plants with
their resources and their networks to win the game.
