Phase 1 - Determine Player Order

During this phase, the new player order is determined.   The first player is the player with the most cities in his
network (first house on the scoring track). If two or more players are tied for the most cities, the first player is
the player among them with the largest-numbered power plant. Place this playerâ€˜s house in the first position in the
player order area. Determine the remaining player positions using the same rules.
